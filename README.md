# Welcome to "theEye"

## About

"theEye" is an Python project that aims to create a virtual eye capable of learning to see using deep learning techniques. It's an exciting endeavor delving into the realms of artificial intelligence.

## What I Do

At its core, "theEye" processes input from four simulated pixels/sensors. Through extensive training and neural network architecture, it endeavors to recognize and interpret shapes. Currently, it's designed to identify basic shapes, such as squares and lines, from its limited input.

### Shape Recognition

## Future Goals

While "theEye" is still in its early stages, my ambition knows no bounds. I aspire to expand its capabilities, enhance its accuracy, and delve into more complex visual recognition tasks (more pixels and shapes).

## Why "theEye"?

- **Innovation:** No.
- **Education:** Offering insights into the world of deep learning.
- **Potential:** Laying the groundwork for future advancements for my lerning of AI pograming.
